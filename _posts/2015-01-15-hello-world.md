Before this began, I was spoilt for choice as to where I should host this site. Should I revert back to simpler old blogging platforms like wordpress or blogger? Should I build this site from scratch with the limited html and css skills which I have? It would be nice to have the freedom of customization/control of html while still not over-complicating this little project of website which I would like to take up. [Github pages](http://pages.github.com) was the clear choice for me.

I have always been a fan of Github and their open source policies. I somehow chanced upon their free Github pages service to host this page for all users. Together with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://github.com/poole/poole), the whole idea of hosting this site as a bunch of static files on my computer caught my eye. So here are some of the advantages of this system that led to my decision.

* Since the static files are located on my computer, I can easily work on this site offline and push it to Github once internet access is available.
* Entirely free service
* Simple Markdown format for content input means I can focus on the content rather than the html/css
* Beautiful minimalist theme.
