    <p>Before this began, I was spoilt for choice as to where I should host this site. Should I revert back to simpler old blogging platforms like wordpress or blogger? Should I build this site from scratch with the limited html and css skills which I have? It would be nice to have the freedom of customization/control of html while still not over-complicating this little project of website which I would like to take up. <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github pages</a> was the clear choice for me.</p>

<p>I have always been a fan of Github and their open source policies. I somehow chanced upon their free Github pages service to host this page for all users. Together with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, the whole idea of hosting this site as a bunch of static files on my computer caught my eye. So here are some of the advantages of this system that led to this decision.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the static files are located on my computer, I can easily work on this site offline and push it to Github once internet access is available.</li>
<li>Entirely free service</li>
<li>Simple Markdown format for content input means I can focus on the content rather than the html/css</li>
<li>Beautiful minimalist theme.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far I&#39;m loving this combination of Github pages, Jekyll and poole. I might post a quick tutorial for creating your own static site in the near future if you are interested in creating a site of your own too. Stay tuned.</p>
